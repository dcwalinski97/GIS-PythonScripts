# GIS-PythonScripts

Python Scripts with GIS Applications

These are scripts that I modified and use while using ArcGIS Pro. If you want to use these you may have to change the scripts to meet your demands.


**CBYD DB Builder:**

This script takes Microsoft Exchange attachments, converts to text files, stores said files, and then scrapes for important infomration regarding Call Before You Dig tickets.


**CBYD into Points:**

This script will take the Excel file from the CBYD DB Builder Script and generate points , upload points to ArcGIS Online. It only takes last 30 days of points but can be changed.
